## Lyrically

Lyrically is music search app created by Alyssa V, Mackenzie G, and Michael W.

With Lyrically, you can search for songs based on words or phrases in the lyrics.

For example, you have a great idea for a TikTok video. You are doing spin tricks on your bike. You want a song that mentions circles. So you open up Lyrically and search circles. Lyrically gives you a list of songs that mention circles in the lyrics. And now you have a set of songs to set your bike video to!
